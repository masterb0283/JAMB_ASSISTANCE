        <div><h1>what you must know about JAMB !!!</h1></div>
        <div><p>The Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) is an entrance examination conducted in Nigeria. It is conducted for tertiary level institutions. It is worthy to note that Jamb being a board conducts and organizes the examination which is called UTME (Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination).Also, once you fail JAMB, you will wait for another year before you can enrole or register for another JAMB</p></div>
        <div><h1>can i pass jamb with only lesson and tutorial ?</h1></div>
        <div><b>unfortunately, the answer is NO.</b></div>
        <div><p>To pass JAMB in one sitting, it's important to  understand that reading and tutorial alone can not make you pass jamb and that is why you are advised to pay for jamb assistance.<br>  In 2024, JAMB recorded a 76% failure rate! <br> there was mass failure not because they did not prepare but because they did not pay for assistance.</p>
